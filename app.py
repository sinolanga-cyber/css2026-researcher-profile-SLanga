reporting. Leveraging tools such as Tableau, SAP BW, SQL, and PowerBI, I deliver insights that inform strategy while simultaneously redesigning processes that strengthen

across business units. I bring a strong commitment to aligning organisational processes with strategic goals and enabling sustainable business transformation through data-driven decision-making and well-designed operational frameworks. ")
